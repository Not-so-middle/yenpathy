# Summary

Finding the shortest paths through a network is a task important to many
problems, from transportation routing to social network analysis. **yenpathy**
provides a method to find the _k_ shortest paths through a network using Yen's
Algorithm [@Yen_1971], previously not available in the R Langauge [@R].

**yenpathy** provides the function `k_shortest_paths()`, which returns *k*
shortest paths between two nodes in a graph, ordered from shortest to longest,
with length determined by the sum of weights of consecutive edges. The function
wraps a C++ implementation of Yenâ€™s algorithm created by Yan Qi [@ksp]. It works
correctly with stand-alone edge lists, as well as with objects from the
**igraph** [@igraph] and **tidygraph** [@tidygraph] packages.

# Usage

To find shortest paths through a network, pass `k_shortest_paths()` a data frame
with rows representing the edges of a graph (`graph_df`), as well as supplying
`from` and `to` nodes in `graph_df`. The function will return a list containing
up to `k` (default 1) vectors representing paths through the graph:


```r
library(yenpathy)

small_graph <- data.frame(
start = c(1, 4, 5, 1, 1, 8, 1, 2, 7, 3),
end = c(4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 6, 2, 7, 3, 6),
weight = c(1, 1, 1.5, 5, 1.5, 2, 1, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5)
)

k_shortest_paths(small_graph, from = 1, to = 6, k = 4)
```

```
## [[1]]
## [1] 1 2 7 3 6
## 
## [[2]]
## [1] 1 4 5 6
## 
## [[3]]
## [1] 1 8 6
## 
## [[4]]
## [1] 1 6
```

You can also pass an `edge_penalty`, a number which is added to all of the edge
weights, effectively penalizing paths consisting of more edges.


```r
k_shortest_paths(small_graph, from = 1, to = 6, k = 4, edge_penalty = 1)
```

```
## [[1]]
## [1] 1 8 6
## 
## [[2]]
## [1] 1 6
## 
## [[3]]
## [1] 1 4 5 6
## 
## [[4]]
## [1] 1 2 7 3 6
```

## API

`k_shortest_paths()` takes a data frame as its first argument (`graph_df`). In
place of a data frame, you can provide an **igraph** [@igraph] or **tidygraph**
[@tidygraph] graph object, which will be converted to a data frame using
`igraph::as_data_frame()`.

By default, the first and second columns are assumed to contain the names of the
the start and end nodes, respectively. These may be either integers or character
vectors. If there is a column named "weights", it is used for edge weights.  You
can change these defaults by passing column numbers or names to the `col_from`,
`col_to`, and `col_weights` arguments.

## An example using flight data

A common application for Yen's algorithm is in transportation planning, when
one wants to find the shortest routes between stops such as airports. Here we use
the `USairports` dataset from the **igraphdata** package to demonstrate how to find
the *k* shortest routes between airports in Bangor, ME (BGR) and Omaha, NE (OMA).


```r
library(igraph)
library(igraphdata)
data("USairports")
paths <- k_shortest_paths(USairports, "BGR", "OMA",
                          k = 20, col_weights = "Distance")
paths[1:5]
```

```
## [[1]]
## [1] "BGR" "DTW" "OMA"
## 
## [[2]]
## [1] "BGR" "DTW" "AZO" "ORD" "OMA"
## 
## [[3]]
## [1] "BGR" "DTW" "AZO" "ORD" "DSM" "OMA"
## 
## [[4]]
## [1] "BGR" "DTW" "DSM" "OMA"
## 
## [[5]]
## [1] "BGR" "DTW" "ORD" "OMA"
```

The result shows the airport *nodes*, but we can use the `paths` object to look
up the *edges*, or flights, that make up these itineraries. In this case, we will
select just the carriers with the most seats for each leg, as `USAairports` includes
multiple edges for each carrier operating flights between an airport pair:


```r
usa <- as_data_frame(USairports)
itineraries <- 
  lapply(paths, function(.x) {
    n_stops <- length(.x)
    legs <- cbind(.x[1:(n_stops - 1)], .x[2:n_stops])
    flights <- apply(legs, 1, function(.z) {
      fl <- subset(usa, from == .z[1] & to == .z[2])
      fl <- subset(fl, Seats == max(Seats))
    })
    do.call(rbind, flights)
  })
itineraries[1:5]
```

We can calculate the total distance of each itinerary:


```r
sapply(itineraries, function(.x) sum(.x[["Distance"]]))
```

```
##  [1] 1401 1401 1401 1401 1401 1401 1402 1402 1402 1402 1404 1405 1405 1407
## [15] 1407 1408 1411 1414 1416 1416
```

### Performance

A number of packages, such as **igraph** and **dodgr**,  provide functions to 
find the shortest path between two nodes on a network, or *all* "simple" (non-looping)
paths between nodes. For the *single shortest* path, these packages can be faster than
**yenpathy**:


```r
library(bench)
set.seed(42)
network <- sample_smallworld(1, 20, 4, .05)
bench::mark(
  shortest_paths(network, from = 1, to = 10),
  k_shortest_paths(network, from = 1, to = 10, k = 1),
  check = FALSE
)
```

```
## # A tibble: 2 x 6
##   expression                                            min median
##   <bch:expr>                                          <bch> <bch:>
## 1 shortest_paths(network, from = 1, to = 10)          145us  169us
## 2 k_shortest_paths(network, from = 1, to = 10, k = 1) 534us  610us
## # ... with 3 more variables: `itr/sec` <dbl>, mem_alloc <bch:byt>,
## #   `gc/sec` <dbl>
```

However, to calculate *k* shortest paths, one generally has to calculate *all*
such paths, and later subset. Doing this with `igraph::all_simple_paths()` can
be considerably slower, even on a very simple network, and impossible due to
memory or time constraints for large, densely-connected graphs.


```r
network <- sample_smallworld(1, 8, 3, .05)
bench::mark(
  all_simple_paths(network, from = 1, to = 5, mode = "all"),
  k_shortest_paths(network, from = 1, to = 5, k = 1),
  check = FALSE
)
```

```
## # A tibble: 2 x 6
##   expression                                                    min  median
##   <bch:expr>                                                <bch:t> <bch:t>
## 1 all_simple_paths(network, from = 1, to = 5, mode = "all")  51.7ms  53.7ms
## 2 k_shortest_paths(network, from = 1, to = 5, k = 1)        430.9us 486.6us
## # ... with 3 more variables: `itr/sec` <dbl>, mem_alloc <bch:byt>,
## #   `gc/sec` <dbl>
```
